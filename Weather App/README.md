Notes

Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and update the apiKey constant in weather.go.
The program uses metric units (Celsius) for temperature.
Errors (e.g., invalid city names, network issues) are displayed with clear messages.
The code follows Go best practices, including proper error handling and formatting with gofmt.
On Windows CMD, enter city names without spaces or use quotes for multi-word cities (e.g., "New York").
